# Notes
- Hotspots checked: benchmark scenario realism, timing methodology, flaky sleep-based tests, security-permission test coverage.
- Assumptions: benchmark metrics are intended for trend tracking and decision making.
- Possible false positives: if benchmark is only demo, urgency is lower but still misleading for perf claims.
