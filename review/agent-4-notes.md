# Notes
- Hotspots checked: server TUI route queueing, session streaming/async routes, ACP usage/session management, LSP client lifecycle.
- Assumptions: server runs long-lived and handles intermittent disconnects/network failures.
- Possible false positives: small single-user sessions may mask these issues short term.
