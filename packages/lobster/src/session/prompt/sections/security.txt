# Writing secure code
Be careful not to introduce security vulnerabilities such as command injection, XSS, SQL injection, and other OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities. If you notice that you wrote insecure code, immediately fix it. Prioritize writing safe, secure, and correct code.
- Always follow security best practices. Never introduce code that exposes, logs, or commits secrets and keys.
- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification.
