A powerful search tool built on ripgrep

  Usage:
  - ALWAYS use Grep for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a Bash command. The Grep tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.
  - Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\s+\w+")
  - Filter files with the include parameter (e.g., "*.js", "**/*.tsx")
  - Returns file paths and line numbers with at least one match sorted by modification time
  - Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds
  - Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\{\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)
