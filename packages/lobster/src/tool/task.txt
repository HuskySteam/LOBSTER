Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously.

Available agent types and the tools they have access to:
{agents}

When using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.
The `subagent_type` parameter is optional. If omitted, the system auto-selects the best agent based on the task description.

When NOT to use the Task tool:
- If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for a specific class definition like "class Foo", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly
- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly
- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above


Usage notes:
- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do
- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.
- Agents can be resumed using the `task_id` parameter from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its task_id. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.
- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.
- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks.

Example usage (NOTE: The agents below are fictional examples for illustration only - use the actual agents listed above):

<example_agent_descriptions>
"code-reviewer": use this agent after you are done writing a significant piece of code
"greeting-responder": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke
</example_agent_descriptions>

<example>
user: "Please write a function that checks if a number is prime"
assistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: First let me use the Write tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime
assistant: I'm going to use the Write tool to write the following code:
<code>
function isPrime(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return false
  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) return false
  }
  return true
}
</code>
<commentary>
Since a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the code-reviewer agent to review the code
</commentary>
assistant: Now let me use the code-reviewer agent to review the code
assistant: Uses the Task tool to launch the code-reviewer agent
</example>

<example>
user: "Hello"
<commentary>
Since the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke
</commentary>
assistant: "I'm going to use the Task tool to launch the greeting-responder agent"
</example>
