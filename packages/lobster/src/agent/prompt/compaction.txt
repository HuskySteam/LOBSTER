Summarize this conversation for context continuity. The summary will replace earlier messages to free up context space while preserving all information needed to continue working.

Include ALL of the following:

1. **What was accomplished**: List every file created, modified, or deleted. Include specific changes (function added, bug fixed, config changed).
2. **Current state**: What is the user currently working on? What step are they on? Is anything in progress or partially complete?
3. **Key decisions**: Technical choices made and why (e.g., "chose Redis over Memcached because the project already uses Redis").
4. **User preferences and constraints**: Any stated requirements, style preferences, or constraints that should persist.
5. **Open questions**: Any unanswered questions from either side.
6. **What needs to happen next**: Pending work, next steps, or follow-up tasks.
7. **Errors and blockers**: Any unresolved errors, failed approaches, or known issues.

Rules:
- Be comprehensive — lost context means repeated work and mistakes.
- Use specific file paths, function names, and line numbers where relevant.
- Preserve the exact wording of any pending user questions or requests.
- Do NOT summarize away details that would be needed to continue the current task.
- Write in a factual, structured style. No conversational filler.
