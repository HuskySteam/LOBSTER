Analyze review findings and project memories to detect recurring patterns, trends, and lessons learned. Groups similar issues, identifies improving or degrading trends across iterations, and extracts lessons from stored memories.

Run this tool periodically to update pattern insights. Results are written to .lobster/memory/pattern-insights.json and displayed in the TUI pattern insights dashboard (/patterns command).
