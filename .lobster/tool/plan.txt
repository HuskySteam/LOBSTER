Create a structured implementation plan for a complex task. Analyzes the codebase using keyword matching to find relevant files, groups them into dependency-ordered steps, estimates complexity, and identifies risks.

Use this tool when you need to plan a multi-step implementation before writing code. Provide a clear task description and the tool will:
- Scan the codebase for relevant files
- Analyze file complexity and dependencies
- Generate ordered implementation steps
- Identify risks (high-complexity files, high fan-in modules, missing tests)

The plan is saved to .lobster/memory/plans/ and can be tracked with the plan_status tool.
