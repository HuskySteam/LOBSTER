Record structured review findings from a code review. The reviewer agent should call this tool to write findings with severity levels, descriptions, and file locations. Findings are stored in .lobster/memory/review-findings.json and displayed in the TUI review results dashboard.

Use this tool after reviewing code to record specific issues found:
- critical: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risks
- high: Bugs, missing error handling, logic errors
- medium: Code quality issues, missing validation
- low: Style issues, minor improvements
